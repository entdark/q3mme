    CaNaBiS took his place of programmer while auri joined to write the
    tutorials, manage the forum and act as beta tester.  mme has become
    a big project with many features.  Development had stopped in 2010,
    but now in 2014 it begins again with the new programmer: ent.
    Many things have been worked on, bugs have been fixed, exciting new
    features have been added. The forum works, feedback and inspiration
