Q3MME 1.9

Additions:

Changes:
- holding mouse2 is chase view now lets roll the view
- set new default value for com_affinity "0": pipe capture is considered default and it works faster with all cores
- set new default value for mme_cpuSSE2 "1"

- fixed incorrectly moving shaders in 1st person and also adjusted precision of shaders time calculations

Q3MME 1.8

Additions:

Fixes:
- fixed aspect ratio of the demo HUD
- fixed memory "leak" that made the game use about 200 more MB than necessary
- fixed configs saving only cvars with non-default values that could cause wrong configs load from other extra mods

Q3MME 1.7

- added movement keys (cg_drawMovementKeys*)
- added chatbox support (mov_chatBox*)
- added possibility to select on startup which cores to use for quake3mme.exe for multicore processors (com_affinity)

- added wallhack (mov_wallhack)
- added speedometer (cg_drawSpeedometer*)
- added possibility to choose when rewards start using counter (mov_rewardCount)
- added hidden frame buffer object effects such as bloom and rotoscope with disabling frame buffer custom resolution, motion blur and anti-aliasing (r_framebuffer*)
- added an opportunity to control delta time when comparing the same sounds to decide on mixing them on not (s_mixSameTime)
- added alphabetical cvar sorting when saving them into a config
- added an opportunity to toggle 0 and 1 values in cvars (cvar_exampleName !)
- added an opportunity to control sound attenuation level (s_attenuate)
- added pixel buffer object to speed up capturing (implemented by teh) (mme_pbo)
- added an opportunity to start the game without window border (r_noborder)
- added an opportunity to capture avi with audio (mme_saveWav 2)
- added stereoscopic 3d capture (r_stereoSeparation, r_zproj)
- added saving speed of demo playback into mme project files
- added a condition to not draw status if followed client is dead
- made lagometer draw ping graph in demo playback
- added underwater sound effect (s_effects)
- added scriptable depth of field feature (dof)

- fixed resetting everything on fast frame update
- fixed possible crash when the game sent to play custom background music in mme mode
- made announcer sounds hearable everywhere, not just when pov is in predicted client
- fixed incorrect capturing with cl_avidemo and added an opportunity to capture with motion blur with cl_avidemo
- fixed incorrectly finishing demo convertion that could cause memory leak if it failed to open a new mme demo for writing
- unlocked demo smoother
- added ratio fix for 2d elements for non-4:3 screens (mov_ratioFix)
- fixed sometimes drawing first person weapon when pov was set to non-predicted client and it was the intermission
